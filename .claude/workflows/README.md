# Workflows

This directory contains reusable workflow templates and patterns for AI-assisted development.

## Purpose

Workflows define step-by-step processes that can be automated or followed consistently across projects. Unlike agents (which are autonomous), workflows are structured templates for common development tasks.

## Planned Workflows

### Development Workflows
- **Project Setup** - Initialize new projects with standard structure
- **Git Integration** - Streamlined git operations and branch management  
- **Testing Orchestration** - Intelligent test execution based on changes
- **Code Review** - Automated quality checks and review processes

### Deployment Workflows
- **Environment Setup** - Configure development/staging/production environments
- **CI/CD Pipeline** - Continuous integration and deployment templates
- **Dependency Management** - Handle updates, security, and compatibility

### Documentation Workflows
- **README Generation** - Auto-generate and maintain project documentation
- **API Documentation** - Generate docs from code annotations
- **Changelog Maintenance** - Track and document project changes

## Usage

Workflows will be implemented as:
- **Markdown templates** - Step-by-step guides
- **TypeScript modules** - Automated workflow execution
- **Hook integrations** - Trigger workflows based on events

## Status

ðŸš§ **Under Development** - Workflows are being designed based on real project usage patterns and requirements identified in our agent development roadmap.

See `../docs/agent-development-roadmap.md` for detailed planning and priorities.
