# ROADMAP

## Vision
A comprehensive Claude-based agent system for automating development workflows and enhancing productivity.

## Current State
- ✅ Basic hook system implementation
- ✅ Bun integration for fast execution
- ✅ Event-driven architecture (UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, etc.)
- ✅ Session data logging to local files
- ✅ Audio notifications on task completion
- ✅ Local sound file integration

## Short Term
- [ ] Enhanced notification system (different sounds per event type)
- [ ] Desktop notification integration (macOS/Linux/Windows)
- [ ] Session analytics and reporting
- [ ] Enhanced agent modularity
- [ ] Agent state management
- [ ] Better error handling and logging
- [ ] Documentation improvements

## Medium Term
- [ ] Specialized agent types (code review, testing, deployment)
- [ ] Agent communication protocols
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Configuration templates

## Long Term
- [ ] AI agent marketplace integration
- [ ] Advanced workflow orchestration
- [ ] Multi-language support beyond TypeScript
- [ ] Cloud deployment options

## Ideas for Investigation
- Integration with popular dev tools (VS Code, GitHub Actions)
- Machine learning for workflow optimization
- Community agent sharing platform
- Real-time collaboration features
- External service integrations (Slack, Discord, webhooks)
- Smart notification filtering and routing
- Voice synthesis for audio feedback
- Progress tracking and visualization dashboards
