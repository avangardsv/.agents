# Logging System Simplification

**Date**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: üîÑ In Progress
**Task**: Remove complex logging services from hooks, implement simple logging via prompts

---

## üìã Context

Following the successful implementation of the logging system bug fix (see [logging-system-implementation.md](./logging-system-implementation.md)), the user requested further simplification of the logging architecture in the `.agents/.claude` workspace.

### Previous State (2025-10-03)

The system had:
- ‚úÖ Working session state persistence (`.claude/services/sessionState.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Fixed session aggregator (`.claude/services/sessionAggregator.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Daily log generation with proper merging
- ‚ùå Complex logging infrastructure in hooks
- ‚ùå Multiple service files managing logging

### User Request

> "remove logging services under .agents/.claude/hooks, keep as simple as possible logging instead of script we will run prompt on hook"

---

## üéØ Goals

1. **Simplify hook system** - Remove complex logging services from `.agents/.claude/hooks`
2. **Prompt-based logging** - Replace script-based logging with prompt-driven approach
3. **Maintain functionality** - Keep essential session tracking without complexity
4. **Keep services** - Logger services in `.agents/.claude/services/` remain (not in hooks)

---

## üèóÔ∏è Current Architecture

### Services Location
```
.agents/.claude/services/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logger.ts             # Simple logger utility
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sessionAggregator.ts  # Daily log generator (fixed)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sessionState.ts       # Session persistence
```

### Hooks Location
```
.agents/.claude/hooks/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts       # Main hook configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib.ts         # Hook infrastructure
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ session.ts     # Minimal session tracking
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sounds/        # Audio notifications
```

## üîÑ Changes Made

### What Was Requested

1. Remove complex logging from `.agents/.claude/hooks/` folder
2. Keep logging simple
3. Use prompts instead of scripts for logging

### What Needs Clarification

- **Services vs Hooks**: Services are in `.agents/.claude/services/`, not hooks
- **Prompt-based approach**: How should prompts trigger logging?
- **Keep or remove**: Should services like `sessionAggregator.ts` stay?

## üìä File Analysis

### .agents/.claude/hooks/index.ts (Current)
- Lines: 186
- Contains: Hook handlers, safety mechanisms, sound notifications
- Logging: Currently integrates with sessionState service

### .agents/.claude/services/
- `logger.ts` (4002 bytes) - Basic logging utility
- `sessionAggregator.ts` (13064 bytes) - Daily log generation (fixed version)
- `sessionState.ts` (3886 bytes) - Session data persistence

---

## üí° Proposed Approach

### Option 1: Minimal Hook Logging
```typescript
// .agents/.claude/hooks/index.ts
export const hooks: Hooks = {
  userPromptSubmit: async (payload) => {
    // Log via simple prompt instead of complex service
    console.log(`Task: ${payload.prompt.slice(0, 100)}`);
  },
  stop: async () => {
    console.log('Session complete');
    playSound(); // Keep notifications
  }
};
```

### Option 2: Keep Services, Simplify Hooks
- Keep `.agents/.claude/services/` as-is (already fixed and working)
- Remove complex logic from `.agents/.claude/hooks/index.ts`
- Use hooks only for triggering, not processing

### Option 3: Prompt-Driven Logging
- Let Claude Code handle logging via prompts
- Remove all automated logging from hooks
- Rely on manual documentation requests

## üîç Current Session Work

### Tasks Completed (Today)
1. ‚úÖ Analyzed current logging architecture
2. ‚úÖ Reviewed `.agents/.claude/hooks/` vs `.agents/.claude/services/`
3. ‚úÖ Created documentation about recent work
4. üîÑ Awaiting decision on simplification approach

## ‚ùì Questions for User

1. **Services location**: The logging services are in `.agents/.claude/services/`, not `.agents/.claude/hooks/`. Should we:
   - Remove services from `.agents/.claude/services/`?
   - Just simplify hook integration in `.agents/.claude/hooks/index.ts`?

2. **Prompt-based logging**: How should this work?
   - Manual prompts to document work?
   - Automated prompts triggered by hooks?
   - Remove all automated logging?

3. **Keep functionality**: Which features to preserve?
   - Session state tracking?
   - Daily log generation?
   - Sound notifications?

## üéØ Next Steps

Waiting for clarification on:
1. Exact scope of "remove logging services under hooks"
2. Desired prompt-based approach
3. Which features to keep vs remove
