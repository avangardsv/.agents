# Exports

This directory contains exported conversation files from Claude Code and other AI development tools.

## Purpose

Storage for complete conversation exports that provide:
- **Full conversation history** - Complete record of AI interactions
- **Backup and archival** - Preserve important development discussions  
- **Analysis and review** - Detailed examination of complex problem-solving sessions
- **Knowledge transfer** - Share detailed technical discussions with team members

## File Types

### Claude Code Exports
- **`.txt` files** - Plain text conversation exports from Claude Code
- **Auto-named** - Files named based on conversation topic and date
- **Complete records** - Include all messages, tool usage, and responses

### Future Export Types
- **JSON exports** - Structured data for programmatic analysis
- **Markdown exports** - Formatted conversations for documentation
- **Session summaries** - Condensed versions of long conversations
- **Tool usage reports** - Analysis of development tool effectiveness

## Usage Patterns

### When to Export
- **Complex problem solving** - Multi-step technical solutions
- **Important decisions** - Architectural or design choice discussions
- **Learning sessions** - Valuable educational conversations
- **Error resolution** - Detailed troubleshooting processes

### Export Management
- **Review before committing** - Exports may contain sensitive information
- **Organize by project/topic** - Use subdirectories for large projects
- **Archive periodically** - Move old exports to long-term storage
- **Index important exports** - Create catalog of key conversations

## Difference from Logs

### Exports (`../exports/`)
- **Complete conversations** - Full back-and-forth dialogue
- **Manual export process** - User-initiated from Claude Code
- **Detailed context** - All nuances and exploration paths
- **Larger file sizes** - Complete conversation history

### Logs (`../logs/`)
- **Structured summaries** - Time-based action logs
- **Automatic generation** - Created by hooks system
- **Focused content** - Request/Action/Files/Tools format
- **Daily organization** - One file per day

## Integration

### With Documentation
- Reference exports in project documentation
- Extract key insights for team knowledge base
- Use for creating technical guides and tutorials

### With Development Process  
- Review exports during project retrospectives
- Analyze problem-solving patterns for improvement
- Share complex solutions with team members
- Archive significant technical discussions

### With Learning Systems
- Analyze conversation patterns for AI improvement
- Identify common question types and solutions
- Build knowledge bases from successful interactions

## Best Practices

### Export Selection
- Export conversations with lasting value
- Focus on complex problem-solving sessions
- Include architectural and design discussions
- Save error resolution processes

### File Organization
- Use descriptive filenames when possible
- Create subdirectories for different projects
- Group related conversations together
- Maintain consistent naming conventions

### Privacy and Security
- Review exports for sensitive information
- Remove credentials, API keys, or private data
- Consider access controls for confidential projects
- Be mindful of intellectual property in exports

These exports complement the automated logging system by providing detailed conversation context for important development discussions.
